##BPSK and BFSK simulation over AWGN channel 
###BER vs SNR plot
- BPSK.m produces BER vs SNR plot of BPSK simulation for triangular and square wave with pulse of length 8. The plots are put in name BPSK_sq.png and BPSK_tr.png (square and triangular wave pulse respectively)
- BFSK.m produces BER vs SNR plot of BFSK simulation. The plot is put in name BFSK.png
